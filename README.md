Database management is more essential today in numerous scientific, engineering, commercial, and business applications. 
As such, it has evolved from a specialized computer application to a central component of a modern computing environment.
This course explores the fundamental concepts and techniques of database management, focusing more on database design and 
programming aspects in particular for relational data. Also, we learn how the DBMS retrieves the data you are asking for. 
We will talk about how data is stored internally, what mechanism exist to access this data and 
how the DBMS determines which algorithm to use to answer to user queries as fast as possible.
